# If you want to setup the bot for you

## In the first time

in the stables-discord-bot directory run :

`npm i`

create `.env` file and add token id of your discord bot and the chan id of the channel where you want the bot send messages.

for example :

```
TOKEN = *your token*

CHANID = *your chan id*
```

## In the second time
 when you had setup .env file
 
install node v+18

## To start the bot
run in command line 

`node index.js`

when you see `discord bot ready` in console the bot is running
